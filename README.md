# Speed Typing Test Application  
A desktop application that challenges users to improve their typing speed and accuracy. Built using Python and the Tkinter library, this app provides a user-friendly interface to test typing skills and calculate words per minute (WPM).  

## Features  
- **Welcome Screen**: A simple interface with a welcome message and a start button to initiate the typing test.  
- **Typing Challenge**: Displays a random sentence for the user to type and measures the time taken.  
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Calculates and displays typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the user's input and accuracy.  
- **Interactive Design**: Reset functionality allows multiple test attempts.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: The core programming language for logic and functionality.  
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).  

## Customization  
- **Modify Sentences**: Add or change sentences in the `sentences` list to customize the typing challenges.  
- **Styling**: Adjust the `tk.Label` and `tk.Button` widget properties to enhance the visual design.  
- **Additional Features**: Extend functionality by including features like error highlighting, average WPM tracking, or a leaderboard.
